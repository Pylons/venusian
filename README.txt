venusian
========

Venusian is a library which allows framework authors to defer
decorator actions.  Instead of taking actions when a function (or
class) decorator is executed at import time, you can defer the action
usually taken by the decorator until a separate "scan" phase.

See the "docs" directory of the package or the online documentation at
http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/venusian/dev/ .
