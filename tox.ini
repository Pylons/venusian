# nose-exclude 0.2.X breaks both pypy and python3; see

# we separate coverage into its own testenv because a) "last run wins" wrt
# cobertura jenkins reporting and b) pypy and jython can't handle any
# combination of versions of coverage and nosexcover that i can find.
# coverage <3.4 is required by nosexcover 1.0.4.
