Change Log
==========

Next release
------------

- Bug fix: when a venusian decorator used as a class decorator was
  used against both a class *and* a subclass of that class, the
  superclass and subclass would effectively share the same set of
  callbacks.  This was not the intent: each class declaration should
  have its own local set of callbacks; callbacks added via decorations
  should not be inherited.

- Arrange test fixtures into a single directory.

0.3 (2010-06-24)
----------------

- Ignore orphaned modules (``.pyc`` or ``.pyo`` files without a
  corresponding ``.py`` file) during a scan.

0.2 (2010-04-18)
----------------

- Add the concept of scan categories (see the "Scan Categories"
  section of the documentation) to allow an application to make use of
  more than one Venusian-using framework simultaneously.

0.1 (2010-02-15)
----------------

- Initial release.
