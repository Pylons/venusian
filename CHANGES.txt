Change Log
==========

1.0a3 (2012-02-08)
------------------

- Add an ``ignore`` argument to the ``scan`` method of a ``Scanner``.  This
  argument allows a user to ignore packages, modules, and global objects by
  name during a ``scan``.  See the "ignore Scan Argument" in the narrative
  documentation for more details.

1.0a2 (2011-09-02)
------------------

- Close ImpLoader file handle to avoid resource warnings on Python 3.

1.0a1 (2011-08-27)
------------------

- Python 3 compatibility.

- Allow an ``onerror`` callback to be passed to ``Scanner.scan()``.

0.9 (2011-06-18)
----------------

- Prevent corner case scan-time exception when trying to introspect insane
  module-scope objects.  See https://github.com/Pylons/venusian/issues/5 .

0.8 (2011-04-30)
----------------

- Normal "setup.py test" can't support running the venusian tests under py
  2.4 or 2.5; when it scans the 'classdecorators' fixture, it barfs.  To get
  around this, we used to depend on ``nose`` in ``setup_requires`` and tell
  "setup.py test" to use nose by setting test_suite to "nose.collector" but
  we can't anymore because folks use Venusian in systems which install from
  pip bundles; pip bundles do not support setup_requires.  So, sorry, we're
  painted into a corner; at this point you just have to know to install nose
  and run "setup.py nosetests" rather than "setup.py test".  Or just run
  "tox" which tests it under all Pythons.

0.7 (2011-03-16)
----------------

- Use Pylons theme in documentation.

- Fix orphaned pyc test on pypy.

- Fix GitHub Issue #1: subclasses of decorated classes that do not
  have any decorations should not inherit the decorations of their
  parent classes. 

- Fix GitHub Issue #2: scans should only "find" each object once per
  scan, regardless of how many modules that object is imported into.

0.6 (2011-01-09)
----------------

- Some metaclasses (Elixir's) don't raise an AttributeError when asked for a
  nonexistent attribute during a scan.  We now catch all exceptions when
  interrogating an object for ``__venusian_callbacks__`` rather than just
  AttributeError.

0.5 (2010-12-19)
----------------

- Make ``codeinfo`` attribute available as an attribute of the AttachInfo
  object. It will be a tuple in the form ``(filename, lineno, function,
  sourceline)`` representing the context of the venusian decorator.  Eg.
  ``('/home/chrism/projects/venusian/tests/test_advice.py', 81,
  'testCallInfo', 'add_handler(foo, bar)')``

0.4 (2010-09-03)
----------------

- Bug fix: when a venusian decorator used as a class decorator was
  used against both a class *and* a subclass of that class, the
  superclass and subclass would effectively share the same set of
  callbacks.  This was not the intent: each class declaration should
  have its own local set of callbacks; callbacks added via decorations
  should not be inherited, and a superclass should not receive its
  subclass' decorations.

- Arrange test fixtures into a single directory.

0.3 (2010-06-24)
----------------

- Ignore orphaned modules (``.pyc`` or ``.pyo`` files without a
  corresponding ``.py`` file) during a scan.

0.2 (2010-04-18)
----------------

- Add the concept of scan categories (see the "Scan Categories"
  section of the documentation) to allow an application to make use of
  more than one Venusian-using framework simultaneously.

0.1 (2010-02-15)
----------------

- Initial release.
