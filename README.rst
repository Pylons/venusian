Venusian is a library which allows framework authors to defer
decorator actions.  Instead of taking actions when a function (or
class) decorator is executed at import time, venusion-based decorators
can defer the action usually taken until a separate "scan" phase.

See the "docs" directory of the package or the online documentation at
https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/venusian/en/latest/
